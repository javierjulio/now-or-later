# Introduction

A sample To-Dos application to learn how to use Backbone.js and CoffeeScript.

# Setup

Install the CoffeeScript npm package. Follow the instructions at http://jashkenas.github.com/coffee-script/#installation for the details. From there just run index.html in any modern browser that supports HTML5 local storage. Todos are persisted so close the app and reopen and it'll load all todos from local storage.
